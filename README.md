# VirtualTourist
Tour the world from the comfort of your couch! You can drop pins on a map and pull up Flickr images associated with that location in a collection view. You can also refresh the collection view, which downloads a new set of photos from Flickr. Locations and images are persisted using Core Data. 

Virtual Tourist is written in Swift 3. You can download it and run it in any version of Xcode and Simulator. To contribute, submit a pull request.
